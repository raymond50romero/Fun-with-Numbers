### Created Math logic
    I created a file that incorporates all of the mathematical logic for the main function of the web page whitch is finding and doing things with prime numbers. 
    So far I have a function to find prime numbers, test to see if the number inputed is prime, and get the sum of all prime numbers up to a given location of prime numbers (I should look into summing all prime numbers up to a given prime number).
    all of the primes that are found are stored in local storage as an array of numbers so that we don't have to recalculate all of the prime numbers everytime
    I still need to implement a function that gets all the factors of a number.
